# ArgoCD (decided and deployed 2026-09-13)

GitOps controller for cluster workloads, replacing manual `kubectl apply`/`helm
upgrade` from rpi5-1 for anything that isn't ArgoCD's own bootstrap.

## Decisions

- **Repo:** this repo (`jakerobb/homelab`, confirmed **public** on GitHub), not
  a separate GitOps repo. No git credentials needed — ArgoCD clones over plain
  HTTPS anonymously.
- **Install method:** Helm chart `argo/argo-cd` (`https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm`),
  matching the pattern already used for Cilium (`talos/cilium/values.yaml`).
  Values in [`install/values.yaml`](install/values.yaml) — only deltas from
  chart defaults. Chart defaults are already non-HA (1 replica each), so no
  HA-related overrides were needed.
- **Bootstrap pattern: app-of-apps.** ArgoCD's own Helm install is the one
  manual, non-GitOps step (parallel to how Cilium is installed/upgraded
  directly via `helm`, not GitOps'd onto itself — avoids the chicken-and-egg
  problem of ArgoCD managing its own install). Everything else — starting
  with ArgoCD's own ingress route — is reconciled from
  [`apps/`](apps/) by the root `Application` in
  [`bootstrap/root-app.yaml`](bootstrap/root-app.yaml), which is the second
  and last manual step. Add new apps by dropping an `Application` manifest
  (or, for something simple, raw manifests directly) anywhere under `apps/` —
  the root app recurses.
- **Sync policy: fully automated (`selfHeal: true`, `prune: true`)** on every
  app managed under `apps/`. Chosen deliberately over the safer
  automated-no-prune middle ground: nothing stateful (PVCs etc.) is under
  ArgoCD's management yet — see [`../TODO.md`](../TODO.md#hexos-storage) — so
  prune's main hazard (deleting real stateful data that's missing from a
  manifest) doesn't apply yet. **Revisit this once storage-backed workloads
  (e.g. an NFS-backed `StorageClass` from the HexOS TODO) go under ArgoCD's
  management** — prune deleting a PVC can delete the underlying data,
  depending on the storage class's reclaim policy. Also worth remembering
  day-to-day: self-heal reverts manual `kubectl edit`/`kubectl scale` fixes on
  the next sync (~3 min) unless you pause auto-sync first.
- **Exposure:** `HTTPRoute` on the existing `homelab-gateway`
  ([`apps/argocd-ingress/httproute.yaml`](apps/argocd-ingress/httproute.yaml)),
  hostname `argocd.jakerobb.org`. `server.insecure: true` in the Helm values
  makes ArgoCD serve plain HTTP internally instead of redirecting to its own
  self-signed HTTPS — TLS is terminated at the Gateway instead (see "DNS +
  TLS" below), so this isn't a downgrade.
- **Auth:** no SSO wired up (`dex.enabled: false`). Local admin only for now;
  password is auto-generated in the `argocd-initial-admin-secret` Secret on
  first install (see below). Revisit if/when there's an SSO provider worth
  integrating with.

## DNS + TLS (decided 2026-09-13)

Real, publicly-trusted certs and automatic DNS — no custom root CA to trust
on every device, no manually-added DNS entries per app:

- **DNS:** [`external-dns`](apps/external-dns/application.yaml) (Cloudflare
  provider) watches `HTTPRoute`s cluster-wide and creates/updates DNS-only
  (not proxied — these point at a private LAN IP, so Cloudflare's edge proxy
  would just break) `A` records in the `jakerobb.org` zone automatically.
  Same zone Caddy's Caddyfile-managed records already live in — a **flat,
  shared namespace**, chosen deliberately even though it means external-dns
  needs zone-wide write access, since most/all of Caddy's names are expected
  to migrate into the cluster over time anyway. The TXT ownership registry
  (`registry: txt`, `txtOwnerId: homelab-k8s`) still means external-dns will
  only ever touch/prune records carrying its own marker — it won't adopt or
  delete Caddy's existing records just because a hostname collides.
- **TLS:** [`cert-manager`](apps/cert-manager/application.yaml) with a
  `ClusterIssuer` doing **Let's Encrypt via DNS-01 challenges against
  Cloudflare** ([`manifests/cert-manager-config/`](../manifests/cert-manager-config/)) —
  DNS-01 is required for wildcards anyway, and it means the ACME challenge
  never needs anything publicly reachable. One wildcard `Certificate` for
  `*.jakerobb.org` covers every app's `HTTPRoute` automatically; the Gateway's
  new `https`/443 listener ([`talos/cilium/gateway.yaml`](../talos/cilium/gateway.yaml))
  references the resulting Secret directly, so no per-app cert-manager
  objects are needed going forward.
- **Bootstrap ordering:** the `cert-manager` Application (chart + CRDs) is
  sync-wave `0`; `cert-manager-config` (the `ClusterIssuer` + `Certificate`,
  which need cert-manager's CRDs to already exist) is wave `1`. Root waits
  for wave 0 to be Healthy before applying wave 1.
- **Cloudflare API token:** scoped to `Zone:DNS:Edit` on the `jakerobb.org`
  zone only (Cloudflare's built-in "Edit zone DNS" token template, restricted
  to that one zone). Needed by both cert-manager (DNS-01 solver) and
  external-dns, in their respective namespaces. **Not committed in plaintext
  anywhere** — see "Cloudflare token setup" below. ArgoCD has no SOPS/KSOPS
  decryption wired up, so these two secrets are applied directly to the
  cluster out of band rather than through GitOps sync; the encrypted files
  are still committed to `argocd/secrets/` (excluded from the root app's
  `argocd/apps` recursion) purely for durability/versioning.

### Cloudflare token setup (one-time, manual)

1. Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → **Edit
   zone DNS** template → Zone Resources: restrict to the specific
   `jakerobb.org` zone → Create → copy the token (shown once).
2. Locally, from the repo root (this keeps the plaintext token out of any
   chat/session transcript — only the encrypted result is ever shared):

   ```bash
   read -rsp "Cloudflare API token: " CF_TOKEN; echo
   for ns in cert-manager external-dns; do
     cat > argocd/secrets/cloudflare-api-token.${ns}.sops.yaml <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: cloudflare-api-token
     namespace: ${ns}
   stringData:
     api-token: ${CF_TOKEN}
   EOF
     sops -e -i argocd/secrets/cloudflare-api-token.${ns}.sops.yaml
   done
   unset CF_TOKEN
   ```
3. Apply both directly to the cluster (bypasses git/ArgoCD entirely, same as
   any other SOPS-encrypted file in this repo):

   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/homelab.yaml
   sops -d argocd/secrets/cloudflare-api-token.cert-manager.sops.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   sops -d argocd/secrets/cloudflare-api-token.external-dns.sops.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```
4. `git add argocd/secrets/` and commit — safe, they're encrypted.

## Bootstrap (one-time, manual)

From a machine with `helm`/`kubectl` pointed at the cluster
(`KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/homelab.yaml`):

```bash
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm repo update argo
helm install argocd argo/argo-cd \
  --version 10.9.0 \
  --namespace argocd --create-namespace \
  -f argocd/install/values.yaml
kubectl apply -f argocd/bootstrap/root-app.yaml
```

Get the initial admin password (rotate or replace with SSO later):

```bash
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d; echo
```

Once external-dns and cert-manager have synced and issued the wildcard cert
(see "DNS + TLS" above), browse to `https://argocd.jakerobb.org` and log in
as `admin`. Before that's up, `http://192.168.102.128` with a
`Host: argocd.jakerobb.org` header will hit the same backend over plain HTTP.

## Upgrading ArgoCD itself

Bump the chart version in the `helm install` command above (now that it's
already installed, `helm upgrade` instead) and re-run with the same
`-f argocd/install/values.yaml`. This is the one recurring manual step, by
design — see "Bootstrap pattern" above.
